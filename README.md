Blue notes parsing script for personal use

	NOTE: for computer-readable (not scanned) pdfs I totally recomend [*tabula*](http://tabula.nerdpower.org/)

repo consist three main folders:

 - raw input - pdf and its recognition as a word text
 - txt files by chapter - cleaned manually text, one chop per person
 - simple python script, which chomp texts into 'persons'and makes a guess which line represents what type of data


----------
at this stage I am writing separate algorithms to recognize different data in text.

- [X]  Web and emails
- [X]  Phone and fax
- [X]  Name and surname
	- [ ] solve ', Jn.' problem
- [ ]  adress, state, index
- [ ]  PoBOX
- [ ]  title

raw pdf and word can be found via those links:
